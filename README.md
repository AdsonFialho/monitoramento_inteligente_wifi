# Smart Monitoring Weather Station

Intelligent monitoring, also known as smart monitoring, refers to the use of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, data analytics, and sensors to collect, analyze, and interpret real-time information. These technologies are applied across various industries and aim to provide valuable insights and make more informed decisions.

In the context of intelligent monitoring, data is collected through sensors and connected devices such as surveillance cameras, temperature sensors, tracking devices, and motion sensors. These devices are capable of capturing real-time information and transmitting it to a centralized system.

Once the data is collected, artificial intelligence and machine learning are employed to analyze and process this information. Sophisticated algorithms can identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data, enabling valuable insights to be extracted. For example, an intelligent monitoring system can identify suspicious behavior in a surveillance video or detect an impending machine failure based on sensor data.

Based on these analyses, intelligent monitoring enables more efficient and effective decision-making. For instance, in a smart city context, intelligent monitoring can be used to optimize traffic flow, identify areas requiring infrastructure maintenance, or detect criminal activities
